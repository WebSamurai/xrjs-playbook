Hi all my name is Priyanshu 
Welcome to my you tube channel  
This is the first video of rxjs tutorial series 
 In This video we are coverting some basic topic such as
 * what is rxjs.
 * what is observable
 * reactive promgraming
 
 * What is rxjs ?
 RXJS library is library which allows building the  asynchronous and event base  program by using the observable sequence
This this the extension of the observer pattern
Let first understand the observer pattern.
In this pattern there is an objects   called subject  and which contains the it  the list of  oberservers
Subject is the object which emit the event and all subscribers automatically know the change as append in asyncrous way.
Let take example of tweeter if some is has tween which is you follow .
Then immediate you will get the notification.
Then the person who tweet He is subject and notification receiver is observer.

Rxjs library is just bit head of this implementation use the observable sequences.
You may heard the term call the observable 

The core hart of the rxjs library is the observable sequences.
But what is the  observable ?
Observable are the continuous value producing stream  over the time which can be observe by Observer
We can compere the observable by the river and water which is continewly flow is the value 
Observers are the human which take the water on by demand when the need but
River is continuously flowing.

Observable can generate one or more value.

rxjs is is the reactive programing library.
Now lets  understand the reactive programing is?

Imagine the scenarios
 where you send the http request to the server and you are waiting 
For the response which comes in the future and once the data arrive you have to react .
Or
Waiting for the click on the button and react on on the click
Watching the mouse movement event and react on it
Rxjs is design to work this kind of scenario where the interesting event and activities happen sometime in the future.

RXJS library provider the bunch of operator to work with the observable sequence.
Now we are  familiar with the RXjS library. 

We using the the simple vanila javascript to explore this library and 
Will we go over 100  operator in the series.
Let setup the simple web page with the rxjs library .
Let move the code editor.
I folder open  rxjs and we on nothing but the index.hml page on it. 
We are going to install the rxjs library using npm package 
Let initiate the package.json by npm init command.
I have to answer the fiew question in order to generate the pakckage.json file .
I am giving default by pressing just enter.

Install  rxjs  by command 
npm install rxjs --save

Let take advantage of latest feature of javascript i.e es6
We need some tools to compile the it 
Let install the something called fweback , webpack server and typescrpt for 
bundling and compiling the es6 code into javscript by folowing command
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server  typescript ts-loader  webpack-cli  --dev --save

This the minimul setup to start experimentation with the rxjs library.

Lets setup the typescript compiler option 
Create the tsconfig.json

{ 
    "compilerOptions": {
   "target": "ES5" ,
   "module": "CommonJS",
   "sourceMap": true
}
}  

Let create  webpack.config.js file and setup the configuration for for webpack


const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
    entry: path.join(__dirname, '/app.ts'),
    output: {
        filename: 'app.js',
        path: __dirname
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.tsx?$/,
                loader: 'ts-loader',
                exclude: /node_modules/,
            },
        ]
    },
    resolve: {
        extensions: [".tsx", ".ts", ".js"]
    },
};
